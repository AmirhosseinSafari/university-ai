### Purpose of Question

we have some units with a unique number, capacity of energy that can produce and a number of intervals needs for maintenancing the unit.
also we have some intervals with a number and a minimum energy that should suppied by units.

__important point:__ maintenancing intervals should be behind together

### input files
our input files includes two files with the name intervals.txt and units.txt

#### units.txt :
 - first line includes number of units
 - every 3 lines describe a unit with this format:
 - first line is the unique number of unit
 - second line is capacity of energy that unit can produce
 - third line is number of intervals that need for maintenancing unit

#### intervals.txt :
 - first line includes number of intervals
 - every 2 lines describe an interval
 - firt line is number of that interval
 - second line is minimum energy that required for that interval

### Algorithms
we solved this question with 3 local search algorithms :
 - Hill Climbing
 - Simulated Annealing
 - Genetic Algorithm

### Libraries
 - matplotlib : for showing results on a plot

#### TODO:
- [ ] add genetic algorithm
